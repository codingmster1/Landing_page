    <p>What good is a strong salary if no one is looking to hire for the position? When it 
        comes to coding-related jobs, it appears there's still plenty of opportunity. Here are 
        the current BLS projections for employment growth in the same coding and programming-
        related professions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Web developers: 13%</li>
    <li>Network and computer systems administrators: 5%</li>
    <li>Computer programmers: -7%</li>
    <li>Database administrators: 9%</li>
    <li>Software developers: 21%</li>

<div class="degree">
<h3>Wouldn't having a degree be better?</h3>
</div>
<p>Having a degree <em>can</em> be better. But it's not like becoming a doctor.
For the most part, employers would rather you have the ability to actually have job ready skills.
School can benefit you if they have a good Computer Science program but if you can't apply it 
to the workplace it's futile. There's also so many 
<a href="https://www.practicalecommerce.com/free-websites-to-learn-code">online resources</a> to 
lean on to learn how to code/program.</p>

<div class="smart">
<h3>Don't you have to be smart to learn?</h3>
</div>
<p>Don't beat yourself up just yet. Like anything, it takes practice and persistence. It's 
    good to start off small and with coding languages that are easy to understand. HTML and CSS 
    to name a few. They say if you can print the words "Hello World" you're already on the right
    track.
